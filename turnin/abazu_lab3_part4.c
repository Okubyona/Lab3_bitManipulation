 *	Exercise Description: [ Read an 8-bit value on PA7..PA0 and write that
        value on PB3..PB0PC7..PC4. That is to say,  take the upper nibble of PINA
        and map it to the lower nibble of PORTB, likewise take the lower nibble of
        PINA and map it to the upper nibble of PORTC (PA7 -> PB3, PA6 -> PB2, â€¦ PA1
        -> PC5, PA0 -> PC4) ]
